# pms-ui-request

`pms-ui-request` is one of the internal packages that make up the `pty-mcp-server` project.  
It is responsible for defining structured data types and utilities to represent and handle requests coming from the user interface layer, such as command-line inputs.

In the context of a stdio-mode MCP server, this package specifically handles the parsing and validation of JSON-RPC requests received via `stdin`.  
It acts as the entry point for transforming raw JSON input into well-typed commands that the application layer can interpret and execute.
